          <h3>My GIS Story and Mission</h3>
            <p>My love of maps goes back to my childhood, when I used to look through my family's road atlas and dream of places to go.  I was lucky to have a 3D digital relief map in a classroom, which I would love to run my hands over the Rockies and dream of seeing them in person. My formal GIS journey began after my 11 year old position was eliminated and I began thinking about a new career.  I enrolled in the Itasca Community College online GIS Certificate Program and loved it.  I went on to intern and work in local government Public Works, where I work today.  GIS Cartography is my primary passion; creating well-designed aesthetically-pleasing and informative maps.  I also love Spatial Analysis and bring my STEM degree and experience in analytical thinking and problem-solving. I have a keen eye for image interpretation from my GIS work experience so far.  I'm also passionate about collaborating with others to achieve excellence.</p>
          <h3>My Life</h3>
            <p>My husband Matt and I, and our 4 cats live in St. Louis Park Minnesota, just west of Minneapolis. I enjoy travelling, which goes along with my love of maps. On weekend, you'll find me enjoying the outdoors in my backyard garden, or in a local or state park enjoying outdoor activities like hiking, camping, and kayaking!</p>
          <h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
          <p>I primarily volunteer for a foster-based cat rescue called The Kittens Cradle.  I am currently in a leadership role as a Foster Support Coordinator, serving as a communications conduit between our directors and foster volunteers.  I provide the fosters with supplies and support for successful adoptions.  I also foster cats and kittens and provide administrative support.</p>
          <p>After I complete my Capstone GIS Certificate, I plan to volunteer my GIS skills where there is need, especially with racial equity work.</p>
